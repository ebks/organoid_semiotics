# Cerebral Organoids: A Biological Substrate for Semiosis and Computation

----

Establishing the biological foundation for the subsequent inquiry into organoid semiotics and computation necessitates a thorough examination of the primary system under investigation: the cerebral organoid. This initial chapter delves deeply into the nature of these complex, three-dimensional neural structures, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, which emerge through processes that intricately combine directed differentiation protocols with the remarkable capacity for cellular self-assembly, mimicking key events of early human brain development in vitro. A detailed exploration follows concerning the resultant cytoarchitecture, including the diverse array of neuronal and glial cell types generated – spanning various progenitor populations, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes – the formation of progenitor zones analogous to ventricular and subventricular regions in vivo, the development of rudimentary cortical layering reflecting an inside-out pattern of neurogenesis, and the establishment of synaptic connectivity crucial for intercellular communication. Beyond static structure, attention is directed towards the dynamic functional properties exhibited by these systems as they mature over weeks and months in culture; particularly the spontaneous and evoked patterns of electrical activity, encompassing neuronal spiking, synchronized network bursts, and complex oscillations across various frequency bands, which signify the emergence of functional neural networks capable of integrated activity. The chapter will further situate organoids within the broader research landscape, discussing their significant utility as models for human neurodevelopment, neurological disease pathogenesis (ranging from microcephaly to aspects of autism spectrum disorders and neurodegeneration), and comparative evolutionary studies, while also outlining the key experimental methodologies—ranging from multi-electrode arrays and advanced calcium imaging to single-cell transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology—employed to generate the rich, multi-modal data characterizing these systems across molecular, cellular, and network scales. Crucially, a realistic appraisal requires acknowledging the inherent constraints of these in vitro models, including the lack of vascularization and sensory inputs, limitations in architectural fidelity and developmental maturity compared to the in vivo brain, and issues of biological variability, all of which define the boundaries for interpretation and application. Ultimately, this comprehensive overview aims to position the cerebral organoid not merely as a sophisticated biological replica, but as the specific, dynamic, and experimentally accessible substrate upon which the core theoretical investigations into the principles of biological computation and the processes of Peircean semiosis, as explored throughout this book, will be grounded.


**1.1. Principles of Organoid Engineering: Harnessing Self-Assembly for Neural Complexity**

The emergence of cerebral organoid technology signifies a paradigm shift in the study of human brain development and neurological disorders. These three-dimensional (3D) *in vitro* structures, derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), leverage the innate capacity of cells to self-organize, guided by carefully controlled environmental cues, thereby recapitulating fundamental milestones of early human neurogenesis with remarkable fidelity (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). The ability to generate complex, multi-layered neural tissues outside the human body provides an unprecedented platform for dissecting molecular and cellular mechanisms previously obscured by the inaccessibility of the developing human brain. Understanding the engineering principles underpinning organoid formation is crucial for appreciating both their potential as model systems and the inherent biological processes they embody – processes potentially interpretable through computational and semiotic lenses.

The foundation of cerebral organoid generation lies in the unique properties of PSCs. These cells exist in two primary forms utilized for organoid culture: embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the inner cell mass of pre-implantation blastocysts, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The development of iPSC technology, pioneered by Takahashi and Yamanaka (although predating the 2020 reference focus, its impact is fundamental and discussed in all recent reviews, e.g., Xiang et al., 2022), revolutionized the field by enabling the reprogramming of readily accessible somatic cells (such as skin fibroblasts or peripheral blood mononuclear cells) back to a pluripotent state. This is typically achieved through the transient overexpression of a specific set of transcription factors (commonly Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, often supplemented or substituted by others like Nanog and Lin28), which effectively reset the epigenetic landscape and cellular identity to mimic that of ESCs (Xiang et al., 2022). The critical advantage of iPSCs lies in the potential to generate patient-specific cell lines, allowing researchers to create organoid models harboring the unique genetic background associated with an individual's neurological condition. While subtle epigenetic or transcriptomic differences might exist between ESCs and iPSCs, extensive comparative studies indicate that both cell types possess largely equivalent potential to differentiate into complex neural lineages and self-assemble into functional organoids (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022). The defining characteristic shared by both ESCs and iPSCs is pluripotency – the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), thus holding the potential to generate the full spectrum of cell types found in the adult organism, including the vast diversity of neurons and glia constituting the central nervous system (CNS).

The journey from a pluripotent state to a complex cerebral organoid involves a series of carefully orchestrated steps designed to mimic developmental processes *in vivo*. The initial, critical phase is **neural induction**, the process by which PSCs are directed towards a neuroectodermal fate, the precursor tissue of the entire CNS. Many foundational and still widely used protocols employ an "unguided" or "intrinsic differentiation" strategy (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). This typically begins with the dissociation of PSC colonies and their aggregation into 3D structures known as embryoid bodies (EBs). EB formation can be achieved through various methods, including suspension culture in non-adherent U-bottom plates or hanging drop cultures, facilitating essential cell-cell interactions that trigger initial differentiation events. These EBs are then transferred to a minimal neural induction medium, often lacking factors that promote alternative fates (like mesoderm or endoderm) and sometimes containing factors that support neural survival (Marton & Pașca, 2020). Under these conditions, a phenomenon known as "default neuralization" occurs. It is understood that signaling pathways actively maintain pluripotency or promote other germ layer fates; when these signals are absent or inhibited (e.g., Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling, which promotes epidermal fate), PSCs intrinsically adopt a neuroectodermal identity (Heide et al., 2021). This intrinsic capacity reflects the developmental trajectory observed during gastrulation *in vivo*. While powerful in demonstrating self-organization, unguided protocols often yield organoids with significant heterogeneity, containing tissues resembling various brain regions (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, retinal epithelium) intermixed within a single structure due to stochastic activation of different endogenous signaling pathways within the EB (Pașca, 2022).

To overcome this heterogeneity and generate organoids enriched for specific brain regions, **"guided" or "directed" differentiation** protocols have gained prominence (Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). These protocols incorporate specific small molecules or recombinant growth factors at defined time points to mimic the morphogen gradients that pattern the developing neural tube *in vivo*. For generating cerebral organoids with predominantly dorsal forebrain (cortical) identity, a common and highly effective strategy involves **dual SMAD inhibition**. This entails the simultaneous blockade of signaling pathways mediated by BMPs (typically using inhibitors like Noggin, Dorsomorphin, or LDN-193189) and TGF-β/Activin/Nodal (using inhibitors like SB431542 or A83-01) (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022). *In vivo*, BMP signaling promotes dorsal fates, while TGF-β related signals are involved in patterning; their inhibition strongly promotes the specification of anterior neuroectoderm, mimicking signals emanating from organizing centers like the anterior visceral endoderm. Further refinement of regional identity can be achieved through subsequent modulation of other key developmental pathways. For instance, inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway (e.g., using IWP2 or XAV939) during a specific temporal window promotes dorsal telencephalic character, characteristic of the cerebral cortex (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). Conversely, activation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling (e.g., using purmorphamine or SAG) can direct progenitors towards ventral forebrain fates, giving rise to structures resembling the ganglionic eminences which normally produce inhibitory interneurons (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Xiang et al., 2022). Similar principles apply to patterning towards midbrain (using FGF8 and SHH) or hindbrain (using FGFs and retinoic acid) identities, although cortical organoids remain the most widely studied type. The precise timing, concentration, and combination of these factors are critical variables that determine the resulting regional fate and cellular composition, demanding meticulous optimization for reproducible outcomes (Gordon et al., 2023).

Following neural induction and patterning, the nascent neuroepithelial structures, often characterized by the formation of polarized rosette structures reminiscent of the early neural tube, require a supportive environment for further growth and maturation. A crucial step involves embedding these structures within an **extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold**. Matrigel, a basement membrane extract derived from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells, is the most commonly used ECM substrate. It is rich in laminin, collagen IV, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, and various growth factors, providing both essential structural support and biochemical cues that promote neural progenitor survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). Alternatives like purified ECM components (e.g., laminin, hyaluronic acid) or synthetic hydrogels are also being explored to create more defined and reproducible microenvironments, although Matrigel remains prevalent due to its effectiveness (Marton & Pașca, 2020).

Once embedded, the developing organoids are transferred to **long-term maturation culture**. A major challenge for 3D tissue culture is ensuring adequate nutrient and oxygen supply to the interior, especially given the high metabolic demands of neural tissue and the lack of intrinsic vascularization. To address this, dynamic culture systems are commonly employed. **Spinning bioreactors**, which keep the organoids suspended in continuously agitated medium, or **orbital shakers**, which create gentle swirling of the medium in standard culture plates, significantly enhance nutrient and gas exchange compared to static cultures (Pașca, 2022). These methods allow organoids to grow substantially larger (up to several millimeters) and survive for extended periods (months, sometimes exceeding a year), facilitating the study of later developmental events like gliogenesis and synaptic maturation (Heide et al., 2021). More recently, **air-liquid interface (ALI)** culture systems have been adapted for organoids. In this setup, the organoid rests on a porous membrane support, with culture medium supplied from below and direct exposure to air (typically humidified with 5% CO2) from above. This configuration is thought to provide superior oxygenation, mimicking aspects of the pial surface environment *in vivo*, and has been shown to promote neuronal maturation and network activity in some contexts (Xiang et al., 2022). The choice of maturation strategy depends on the specific experimental goals and desired scale of production.

Throughout this multi-step process, from EB formation to long-term maturation, the principle of **self-assembly** remains the defining characteristic. While external cues initiate differentiation and guide regional identity, the intricate processes of tissue morphogenesis—the formation of polarized neuroepithelium, the establishment of progenitor zones, the migration of newly born neurons, the segregation of cell types, and the initial formation of synaptic contacts—are driven largely by intrinsic genetic programs executed within individual cells and mediated by complex local interactions (cell-cell adhesion, juxtacrine signaling, secreted factors acting over short distances) (Heide et al., 2021; Velasco et al., 2021). It is this remarkable capacity for self-organization, mimicking developmental logic *in vitro*, that imbues cerebral organoids with their structural complexity and makes them such a valuable, albeit simplified, model of the developing human brain. This self-organizing potential, grounded in biological rules yet exhibiting emergent complexity, provides the very foundation for considering the organoid as a substrate where computational processes (rule-based transformations of state) and semiotic processes (meaningful sign interactions guiding behavior) might unfold.

Schematic Overview of Cerebral Organoid Generation.** This diagram illustrates the key steps in a common protocol for generating forebrain-patterned cerebral organoids using directed differentiation. *(A)* Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs: ESCs or iPSCs) are cultured and expanded. *(B)* PSCs are dissociated and aggregated into embryoid bodies (EBs) in low-attachment conditions. *(C)* EBs are treated with neural induction factors (e.g., dual SMAD inhibitors) to specify neuroectoderm. *(D)* Patterning factors (e.g., Wnt inhibitors) are applied during a defined temporal window to promote dorsal forebrain (cortical) identity. *(E)* The developing neuroepithelial tissues are embedded within droplets of extracellular matrix (ECM), such as Matrigel, providing structural and biochemical support. *(F)* Embedded structures are transferred to long-term maturation culture, often employing dynamic methods like spinning bioreactors or orbital shakers, or potentially air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, to enhance nutrient/gas exchange and support growth over weeks to months. *(G)* Mature cerebral organoids develop complex structures containing diverse neural cell types, including progenitor zones (VZ/SVZ-like) and regions populated by maturing neurons (CP-like), exhibiting spontaneous electrical activity. This process combines extrinsic signaling cues with intrinsic cellular self-assembly programs. (Adapted from concepts in Pașca, 2022; Heide et al., 2021).

**1.2. Cerebral Organoid Characteristics: Cellular Diversity and Architectural Complexity**

Months-long cultivation under appropriate conditions allows cerebral organoids, particularly those guided towards a cortical fate, to develop a striking level of cellular heterogeneity and structural organization that mirrors, albeit imperfectly, key features of the developing human cerebral cortex (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022). Dissecting this emergent cytoarchitecture provides critical insights into human neurodevelopmental processes and establishes the cellular context for the functional dynamics discussed later.

A fundamental organizational unit frequently observed in developing organoids is the **neural rosette**. These are polarized structures where neural stem and progenitor cells arrange radially around a central lumen, morphologically analogous to the early neural tube or the ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing cortex (Heide et al., 2021). The cells lining the lumen are typically apical radial glial cells (aRGCs), the primary neural stem cells of the developing cortex. These cells express characteristic markers such as PAX6, SOX2, and NESTIN, exhibit apical-basal polarity with apical junctions facing the lumen, and undergo **interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM)** – a process where the nucleus migrates towards the apical surface for mitosis (M-phase) and then back towards the basal side during interphase (G1, S, G2 phases) (Marton & Pașca, 2020). aRGCs undergo both symmetric divisions (producing two identical progenitor cells, contributing to the expansion of the progenitor pool) and asymmetric divisions (producing one aRGC and one cell destined for differentiation, typically either a neuron directly or an intermediate progenitor cell) (Velasco et al., 2021). The lumen of the rosette can be considered analogous to the ventricle *in vivo*.

Basal to these VZ-like zones, organoids often develop regions containing **intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs)**, analogous to the subventricular zone (SVZ) *in vivo*. IPCs, frequently identified by the expression of the transcription factor TBR2 (also known as EOMES), typically lose contact with the apical surface and undergo a limited number of further proliferative divisions within the SVZ-like region before terminally differentiating into neurons (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022). The amplification of neuronal output through IPC divisions is a crucial mechanism contributing to the large number of neurons in the mammalian cortex.

A particularly significant feature relevant to human brain evolution is the presence of **outer radial glia (oRG) cells** (also called basal radial glia, bRG). These progenitors reside in the outer SVZ (oSVZ) *in vivo*, a zone substantially expanded in primates, especially humans. Unlike aRGCs, oRG cells lose their apical contact but retain a basal process extending to the pial surface. They are considered a major driving force behind the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex due to their high proliferative capacity (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022). Excitingly, studies using single-cell transcriptomics and morphological analysis have identified cells with molecular signatures (e.g., expressing HOPX, PTPRZ1 alongside SOX2/PAX6) and characteristic migratory behaviors resembling oRG cells within human cerebral organoids (Gordon et al., 2023; Kanton et al., 2022). While a distinct, anatomically segregated oSVZ layer like that seen *in vivo* is often less clearly defined in organoids, the presence of these key human-specific progenitor types underscores the value of organoids for studying human cortical development and evolution (Heide et al., 2021).

Neurons generated from these diverse progenitor populations migrate outwards, away from the VZ/SVZ-like zones, to populate regions loosely analogous to the **cortical plate (CP)**. This migration generally follows an "inside-out" pattern, similar to cortical development *in vivo*: earlier-born neurons settle in deeper layers, while later-born neurons migrate past them to form more superficial layers (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). Consequently, organoids cultured for sufficient duration exhibit a stratified neuronal organization. Immunostaining reveals neurons expressing markers characteristic of deep cortical layers (e.g., TBR1, CTIP2/BCL11B) situated more internally, closer to the progenitor zones, while markers associated with upper cortical layers (e.g., SATB2, CUX1/2, BRN2/POU3F2) are found in more external positions (Gordon et al., 2023; Kanton et al., 2022; Velasco et al., 2021). Mature neuronal markers like MAP2, NeuN (RBFOX3), and βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) become widely expressed in these neuron-rich regions. However, it is crucial to emphasize that organoids typically fail to recapitulate the precise, sharply demarcated six-layered structure of the mature human neocortex. The layering is often described as "rudimentary," "disorganized," or "layer-like," with considerable intermingling of neuronal subtypes and variability between different organoid structures and even between different VZ-like units within the same organoid (Pașca, 2022). Factors contributing to this include the complex topology often containing multiple VZ/SVZ units, the lack of long-range guidance cues present *in vivo*, and the compressed developmental timeline relative to human gestation.

The neuronal populations generated within cortical organoids are predominantly **excitatory glutamatergic projection neurons**, consistent with their cortical identity. However, functional cortical circuits *in vivo* rely on a critical balance between excitation and inhibition, provided by locally-projecting **GABAergic interneurons**. These interneurons originate primarily from the ventral forebrain (specifically the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences, MGE/CGE) and migrate tangentially over long distances to integrate into the developing cortex (Pașca, 2022). In standard cortical organoid protocols using dual SMAD inhibition and Wnt inhibition, GABAergic interneurons are typically sparse or absent because the ventralizing signals are suppressed (Marton & Pașca, 2020). Unguided protocols might stochastically generate some ventral domains, leading to a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but with poor control. To address this, researchers have developed **"assembloid"** strategies (Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). This involves generating distinct organoids patterned towards dorsal forebrain (cortical) and ventral forebrain (MGE-like) fates separately, and then physically fusing them in culture. Following fusion, MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons (expressing markers like LHX6, DLX2, GAD67) are observed to migrate tangentially into the cortical tissue, integrate structurally, form synapses, and contribute to network activity, creating more complex and potentially more physiologically relevant circuits (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022; Samarasinghe et al., 2021).

Beyond neurons, cerebral organoids undergo **gliogenesis**, typically beginning after the peak of neurogenesis, mirroring the *in vivo* timeline (roughly corresponding to mid-gestation onwards) (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022). **Astrocytes**, the most abundant glial cell type in the CNS, emerge and mature over several months in culture. They can be identified by markers such as GFAP, S100β, AQP4, and ALDH1L1, and develop characteristic stellate morphologies. Astrocytes play crucial roles in synaptic function (forming tripartite synapses with pre- and post-synaptic neuronal elements), regulating the extracellular environment, providing metabolic support, and contributing to blood-brain barrier formation (though the latter is absent in standard organoids) (Velasco et al., 2021). Their presence in maturing organoids is vital for supporting complex neuronal function and network stability. **Oligodendrocytes**, the myelinating cells of the CNS, also develop in organoids, arising from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) expressing markers like OLIG2 and PDGFRA. Mature oligodendrocytes expressing myelin proteins (e.g., MBP, MOG) can be detected, and ultrastructural evidence suggests they are capable of ensheathing axons within the organoid tissue, although achieving robust, widespread, and compact myelination comparable to the *in vivo* state often requires very long culture times (well over 6 months) or specific co-culture conditions promoting myelination (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022).

Notably absent in standard organoid protocols derived solely from neuroectoderm are **microglia**. These are the resident immune cells of the brain, originating from primitive myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac (mesoderm) that invade the CNS during early development (Xiang et al., 2022). Given their crucial roles in synaptic pruning, immune surveillance, and response to injury and disease, their absence represents a significant limitation for modeling certain aspects of brain function and pathology. To overcome this, protocols have been developed to incorporate microglia into organoids, either by co-culturing PSC-derived neural organoids with PSC-derived primitive hematopoietic progenitors or microglia-like cells, or by adding primary human microglia (Xiang et al., 2022; Popova et al., 2021). These "immuno-competent" organoids allow for the study of neuro-immune interactions in development and disease contexts.

Finally, a cornerstone of neural function is **synaptogenesis**, the formation of specialized junctions allowing communication between neurons. Cerebral organoids exhibit robust synapse formation as neurons mature. Immunostaining reveals the expression and punctate localization of key presynaptic proteins (e.g., Synaptophysin (SYP), Synapsin-1 (SYN1), VGLUT1/2 for excitatory synapses, VGAT for inhibitory synapses) and postsynaptic density proteins (e.g., PSD-95, Homer1 for excitatory synapses; Gephyrin for inhibitory synapses) (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). Electron microscopy provides definitive ultrastructural evidence, clearly showing presynaptic terminals filled with vesicles apposed to postsynaptic densities across a synaptic cleft (Marton & Pașca, 2020). As detailed in the next section, electrophysiological recordings confirm that these structural synapses are indeed functional, mediating signal transmission within the developing organoid network. The progressive establishment of this intricate cellular diversity and synaptic connectivity provides the necessary architectural scaffold for the emergence of complex network dynamics and potential computational or semiotic capabilities.

Arrows indicate outward migration of differentiating cells. *(C)* A cortical plate (CP)-like region populated by maturing neurons. Stratification is often observed, with deeper layer neurons (DLN, expressing e.g., TBR1, CTIP2) located more internally and upper layer neurons (ULN, expressing e.g., SATB2, CUX1) more externally. Both excitatory (glutamatergic) and potentially inhibitory (GABAergic, if incorporated via assembloid strategy or stochastic ventralization) neurons exist. *(D)* Developing glial cells, including astrocytes (expressing e.g., GFAP, S100β) and oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OPCs/Oligodendrocytes, expressing e.g., OLIG2, MBP), emerge at later stages. *(E)* Neurons form functional synapses (inset shows presynaptic terminal with vesicles and postsynaptic density). Note that the organization is typically less precise and more variable than depicted. (Markers are examples; expression patterns can overlap and change dynamically). (Based on descriptions in Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022; Gordon et al., 2023).

**1.3. Dynamic Properties: Emergent Electrical Activity and Network Function**

Cerebral organoids are not static structures; they are functionally active, exhibiting complex patterns of spontaneous and evoked electrical activity that emerge and mature over time in culture. Monitoring and analyzing these dynamic properties using techniques like multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and calcium imaging provides crucial insights into the functional development of human neural networks *in vitro* and establishes the physiological basis for exploring their computational and semiotic potential (Sharott et al., 2023; Trujillo & Muotri, 2021).

**Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs)** offer a powerful method for non-invasively recording extracellular electrical activity from neuronal populations within the organoid over extended periods (days to weeks or even months). Organoids are typically placed onto, or integrated with, substrates containing a grid of electrodes (ranging from tens to thousands in high-density MEAs). These electrodes detect two main types of signals: fast voltage transients corresponding to action potentials (spikes) fired by neurons located near the electrode, and slower fluctuations known as local field potentials (LFPs). LFPs represent the summed electrical activity of a larger population of cells in the vicinity of the electrode, reflecting synaptic currents, voltage-gated membrane currents, and afterpotentials, providing a measure of aggregate network activity (Sharott et al., 2023; Buzsáki et al., 2012 - classic reference on LFPs).

MEA recordings reveal a characteristic developmental trajectory of network activity in cerebral organoids. In early stages (first few months), neuronal activity is often sparse and sporadic, consisting of irregular, uncoordinated single spikes (Trujillo & Muotri, 2021). As the organoids mature, typically between 2 to 6 months, activity becomes more robust and organized. A hallmark feature is the emergence of **network bursts**: periods of high-frequency, synchronized firing involving large portions of the network, interspersed with periods of relative quiescence (Sharott et al., 2023; Trujillo et al., 2021). The properties of these bursts – their frequency, duration, the number of participating neurons (burst size), and the degree of synchrony – evolve over developmental time, generally becoming more regular and complex in older organoids. This transition likely reflects the strengthening of synaptic connections, the development of recurrent excitation, and the maturation of inhibitory circuits (if present) that help shape network dynamics (Samarasinghe et al., 2021). Analyzing the precise timing of spikes across different electrodes allows researchers to infer **functional connectivity** – the statistical relationship between the activity of different neuronal populations – revealing patterns of information flow and network organization (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023).

**Calcium imaging** provides a complementary view of network dynamics, often with superior spatial resolution, allowing the activity of hundreds or even thousands of individual neurons to be monitored simultaneously. This technique typically utilizes genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), such as the widely used GCaMP family of proteins, which are engineered to increase their fluorescence intensity upon binding to Ca²⁺ ions (Lin & Schnitzer, 2016 - classic methods review relevant here). Since neuronal firing triggers a transient influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated calcium channels, GECIs expressed in neurons (often via viral transduction or stable integration into the PSC line) act as reporters of spike activity. Alternatively, synthetic calcium-sensitive dyes can be loaded into the tissue. Using fluorescence microscopy – often two-photon microscopy for deeper penetration and optical sectioning in 3D, or light-sheet microscopy for rapid volumetric imaging – researchers can record movies of fluorescence changes across large fields of view within the organoid (Heide et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). Analysis of these movies allows for the identification of individual active neurons and the extraction of their fluorescence time courses (ΔF/F traces), providing a detailed spatio-temporal map of network activity. Calcium imaging studies have confirmed the presence of spontaneous, synchronized network events observed with MEAs and have enabled the identification of **neuronal assemblies** – groups of neurons that tend to fire together repeatedly – potentially representing functional units within the network (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). Tracking the initiation and propagation of activity waves across the organoid provides further insights into functional organization.

Beyond spontaneous activity, organoid networks respond to external stimulation, demonstrating their capacity for input processing. **Electrical stimulation** via MEA electrodes can evoke neuronal firing and network-wide responses, allowing researchers to probe synaptic efficacy and connectivity pathways (Sharott et al., 2023). **Optogenetics**, the use of light to control the activity of genetically modified neurons expressing light-sensitive ion channels (like Channelrhodopsin-2 for excitation or Halorhodopsin/Archaerhodopsin for inhibition), offers more precise spatial and temporal control over neuronal activation or silencing (Boyden et al., 2005 - foundational reference). Optogenetic stimulation in organoids has been used to investigate specific circuit functions, induce plasticity, and even explore the potential for patterned input to drive specific network states (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Trujillo & Muotri, 2021). The ability of the network to respond reliably to, and integrate, external stimuli is a prerequisite for any form of meaningful computation or sign processing.

A particularly significant finding in more mature cerebral organoids (typically >6 months) is the emergence of complex **network oscillations** observed in the LFP recordings from MEAs (Trujillo et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). These are rhythmic fluctuations of network activity occurring within specific frequency bands, analogous to brain waves recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) *in vivo*. Organoid LFPs exhibit oscillations across canonical frequency bands, including delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz) (Trujillo et al., 2021). *In vivo*, these oscillations are thought to play crucial roles in coordinating neuronal activity across different spatial and temporal scales, facilitating communication between brain regions, gating information flow, and supporting cognitive processes like memory consolidation, attention, and sensory perception (Buzsáki & Draguhn, 2004 - classic review). The observation of similar oscillatory patterns emerging spontaneously in *in vitro* organoids suggests that the intrinsic properties of human neurons and their self-organized connectivity are sufficient to generate these complex dynamics, even in the absence of external sensory input or a fully formed brain architecture. Some studies have reported highly complex, non-periodic oscillatory patterns, sometimes resembling features of preterm infant EEG, suggesting a rich dynamic repertoire (Trujillo et al., 2021; Kirihara et al., 2023). The developmental emergence of oscillations from initially less structured activity likely reflects critical stages in network maturation and may represent the establishment of temporal frameworks for information processing.

The underlying **network connectivity** shapes these dynamics. As mentioned, functional connectivity can be inferred from activity correlations. Structural connectivity, the physical map of synaptic connections, can be investigated using techniques like post-hoc immunohistochemistry combined with advanced microscopy, or potentially through electron microscopy reconstruction (though extremely labor-intensive for large volumes). Computational network analysis applied to both functional and inferred structural connectivity data often reveals non-random organization, such as the presence of **small-world** properties (high local clustering combined with short average path lengths between nodes, thought to facilitate both local processing and global integration) and the existence of highly connected **hub neurons** that may play critical roles in coordinating network activity (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023).

The dynamic complexity observed in organoids has also been analyzed through the lens of **neuronal avalanches**. Avalanches are cascades of neuronal activity where the size (number of participating neurons or electrodes) and duration of events follow a power-law distribution. Such distributions are characteristic of systems operating near a **critical state**, poised between randomness and excessive order. Theoretical and experimental work suggests that criticality might be an optimal state for information transmission, storage capacity, and dynamic range (Beggs & Plenz, 2003 - foundational reference; Hesse & Gross, 2014 - review). The observation of avalanche dynamics in some cerebral organoid preparations suggests that these developing networks might spontaneously tune themselves towards such a computationally advantageous regime, further bolstering their potential as systems capable of complex information processing (Trujillo & Muotri, 2021; Kirihara et al., 2023).

In sum, cerebral organoids are not merely structural replicas but functionally dynamic systems. They exhibit a developmental progression of electrical activity from sporadic firing to synchronized bursting and complex oscillations, possess intricate functional connectivity, respond to external stimuli, and may operate near computationally relevant critical states. These dynamic properties provide the essential functional substrate upon which higher-order processes, potentially interpretable as computation or primitive forms of semiosis, could emerge.

**1.4. Organoids as Models: Applications in Development, Disease, Evolution, and Computation**

The capacity of cerebral organoids to faithfully recapitulate crucial aspects of human brain development and exhibit complex cellular and network functions has established them as indispensable tools across a spectrum of neuroscientific inquiry. Their human origin provides a unique advantage over traditional animal models, particularly for investigating species-specific developmental trajectories and human diseases lacking precise animal homologs (Kanton et al., 2022; Pașca, 2022).

One of the most prominent applications is in **modeling human neurodevelopment**. Organoids provide an experimentally tractable window into the intricate processes governing the formation of the human brain during gestation, particularly the first and second trimesters – periods largely inaccessible to direct study *in vivo*. Researchers can meticulously track the specification of different neural lineages from progenitors, observe the dynamics of progenitor proliferation (including symmetric vs. asymmetric divisions and the behavior of key cell types like oRG cells), follow the migration of newly born neurons to form layer-like structures, and witness the onset of synaptogenesis and gliogenesis (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022; Velasco et al., 2021). This allows for mechanistic dissection of fundamental developmental processes, such as the molecular signals controlling cell fate decisions or the cellular machinery driving neuronal migration, within a human context. By manipulating specific genes (e.g., using CRISPR-Cas9) or signaling pathways (using small molecules) within the organoid system, researchers can directly test hypotheses about their roles in normal development (Gordon et al., 2023).

Building upon this developmental foundation, organoids have become exceptionally powerful tools for **modeling neurological and psychiatric disorders** (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022; Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). The ability to generate organoids from patient-derived iPSCs, or to introduce specific disease-associated mutations into control iPSC lines, enables the investigation of disease pathogenesis in a relevant human genetic background and cellular environment. This approach has yielded significant insights into a diverse range of conditions:
*   **Neurodevelopmental Disorders:** Conditions with strong genetic links and early developmental origins are particularly well-suited for organoid modeling. For instance, organoid studies were pivotal in demonstrating that the Zika virus, responsible for microcephaly outbreaks, preferentially infects and eliminates neural progenitor cells, leading to reduced neuronal output and smaller organoid size, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed pathology (Pașca, 2022). Models of idiopathic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and syndromic forms (e.g., Timothy syndrome, Rett syndrome) have revealed diverse phenotypes, including accelerated or delayed neuronal differentiation, altered proportions of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons (leading to E/I imbalance, a hypothesized contributor to ASD), defects in neuronal migration, and abnormalities in synaptic function and network activity (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022; Marton & Pașca, 2020; Samarasinghe et al., 2021). Similarly, organoid models derived from individuals with schizophrenia risk genes have shown disruptions in progenitor proliferation, interneuron development, and synaptic pruning (Xiang et al., 2022).
*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Modeling late-onset diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) in organoids presents challenges due to the inherently fetal nature of the system and the long time course of these diseases *in vivo*. However, researchers are making progress. Organoid models of familial AD (carrying mutations in APP or Presenilin genes) have been shown to develop key pathological hallmarks like amyloid-beta aggregation (plaques) and hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation (tangles) after extended culture periods or using protocols designed to accelerate aging phenotypes (Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). These models allow for investigation of early pathological events and cellular dysfunctions preceding widespread neurodegeneration. Similarly, PD models focus on dopaminergic neuron loss (in midbrain organoids) and alpha-synuclein pathology.
*   **Infectious Diseases:** Beyond Zika, organoids provide a platform to study the interaction of other neurotropic viruses (e.g., Herpes Simplex Virus, Cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2) with human neural cells, identifying cellular tropism, replication mechanisms, and downstream pathological consequences (Xiang et al., 2022; Popova et al., 2021). The inclusion of microglia in some models further enhances their utility for studying neuroinflammatory responses to infection (Popova et al., 2021).

Beyond mechanistic insights, these disease models serve as valuable platforms for **drug screening and therapeutic development**. Compounds can be tested directly on patient-derived organoids to assess their efficacy in correcting specific cellular or network phenotypes, potentially accelerating the identification of personalized treatments (Xiang et al., 2022).

Cerebral organoids also offer unique opportunities for **exploring human brain evolution**. By generating organoids from PSCs of humans and closely related non-human primates (e.g., chimpanzees, gorillas, macaques) and performing comparative analyses (often using scRNA-seq and live imaging), researchers can pinpoint human-specific features of neurodevelopment at the cellular and molecular level (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022). Such studies have identified differences in the duration of cell cycle phases for neural progenitors (longer in humans), the relative abundance and proliferative behavior of specific progenitor types like oRG cells (expanded in humans), the timing of neuronal maturation, patterns of gene expression (including human-specific genes), and aspects of synaptogenesis (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022; Gordon et al., 2023). These findings provide cellular clues to the evolutionary innovations that underlie the increased size and complexity of the human brain and its unique cognitive abilities.

Finally, and of central relevance to this book, the observed complexity and functional dynamics of cerebral organoids position them as intriguing systems for investigating fundamental principles of **biological computation and information processing *in vitro*** (Trujillo & Muotri, 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). The ability of these self-organizing neural networks to generate structured patterns of activity (bursts, oscillations, potentially avalanches), process inputs (respond to stimulation), and potentially undergo activity-dependent modifications (plasticity, discussed in Chapter 4) suggests they possess inherent computational capabilities. While rudimentary compared to the intact brain, organoids offer a simplified, controlled, yet biologically realistic human neural system to explore questions such as: How is information encoded in the spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity? What computational operations can these developing networks perform? How do structure and dynamics relate to information processing capacity? Can organoids exhibit forms of learning or adaptation? Investigating these questions requires moving beyond purely descriptive biology towards quantitative analysis informed by computational neuroscience, network science, and information theory (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). Furthermore, as argued throughout this work, a Peircean semiotic framework may provide complementary insights by focusing on how activity patterns acquire *significance* within the system, guiding subsequent processes or state transitions in a meaningful, context-dependent way. The organoid, therefore, serves not only as a model *of* the brain but potentially as a model system *for* studying the emergence of computation and signification from biological matter itself.

**1.5. Data Generation and Types: Multi-Modal Interrogation of Organoid Systems**

A comprehensive understanding of cerebral organoid biology, bridging structure, function, and molecular composition, necessitates the deployment of a diverse array of experimental techniques. Each method provides a unique window onto the system, and the integration of data across these modalities is essential for constructing a holistic picture, formulating robust hypotheses, and validating computational or semiotic models (Heide et al., 2021; Kanton et al., 2022; Sharott et al., 2023).

The primary methodologies employed for characterizing cerebral organoids include:

*   **Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs):** As extensively discussed (Section 1.3), MEAs are workhorse tools for functional assessment. They provide high-temporal-resolution (sub-millisecond) recordings of extracellular electrical signals – spikes from individual neurons near electrodes and LFPs reflecting aggregate activity – across multiple sites simultaneously (Sharott et al., 2023). Standard MEAs might have 60-256 electrodes, while high-density MEAs (HD-MEAs) boast thousands of electrodes packed closely together, offering significantly improved spatial resolution approaching single-neuron detection across larger areas (Obien et al., 2015 - review relevant to MEA tech). Data generated are typically time series of detected spike times for each active electrode and continuous voltage recordings (LFPs). Analysis focuses on firing rates, burst characteristics, synchrony measures, spectral analysis of LFPs (oscillations), spike timing correlations for functional connectivity inference, and potentially measures derived from information theory like transfer entropy to track directed information flow (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). MEAs are crucial for capturing the fast dynamics underpinning neural communication and network-level computations.
*   **Calcium Imaging:** Complementing MEAs, calcium imaging provides visualization of neuronal activity, often with single-cell spatial resolution across large populations (hundreds to thousands of neurons) (Lin & Schnitzer, 2016). Typically employing GECIs like GCaMP variants expressed in neurons, this technique captures fluorescence changes correlating with intracellular calcium fluctuations triggered by action potentials. Advances in microscopy, particularly two-photon and light-sheet illumination, enable imaging deep within the 3D organoid structure with reduced phototoxicity compared to confocal microscopy, allowing for longitudinal tracking of activity patterns in the same neurons over time (Heide et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). The primary data are time-lapse image sequences (movies). Post-processing involves identifying active cells (regions of interest, ROIs), extracting their fluorescence intensity traces over time (ΔF/F), and potentially inferring spike times through deconvolution algorithms. Analysis focuses on identifying co-active neuronal ensembles, mapping spatio-temporal patterns of activity propagation (waves), quantifying network synchrony, and assessing single-cell responses to stimuli (Liu et al., 2021). Calcium imaging excels at revealing the spatial organization of network function.
*   **Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq):** This transformative genomics technology allows for the high-throughput characterization of the transcriptomes (the full set of RNA transcripts) of thousands of individual cells dissociated from an organoid (Kanton et al., 2022; Gordon et al., 2023). By capturing the gene expression profile of each cell, scRNA-seq enables unbiased classification of cell types and subtypes (various neuronal classes, progenitors, glia), identification of rare cell populations, reconstruction of developmental trajectories or differentiation lineages, and characterization of cellular states (e.g., proliferative, quiescent, stressed) (Kanton et al., 2022; Velasco et al., 2021). Variations like single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) allow analysis of archived frozen samples. The data generated are typically large matrices where rows represent genes and columns represent individual cells, with entries indicating expression levels (e.g., read counts). Sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines involving dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, UMAP, t-SNE), clustering, and differential gene expression analysis are used to interpret these complex datasets. scRNA-seq provides an unparalleled molecular snapshot of the organoid's cellular composition and developmental status. Spatially resolved transcriptomics methods (e.g., Slide-seq, Visium) are also beginning to be applied, linking gene expression profiles back to their spatial location within the organoid tissue (Kanton et al., 2022).
*   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC) / Immunofluorescence (IF) and Advanced Microscopy:** These are essential techniques for visualizing the spatial organization of cells and molecules within the organoid structure. They utilize antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes (IF) or enzymes producing a colored precipitate (IHC) to specifically label proteins of interest in fixed organoid sections or whole-mount preparations (Heide et al., 2021). IHC/IF allows for the confirmation and localization of cell types identified by scRNA-seq (using established marker proteins), visualization of cytoarchitecture (e.g., VZ/SVZ-like zones, layer formation), assessment of neuronal morphology, localization of synaptic proteins (providing structural evidence for synapses), and detection of pathology markers (e.g., protein aggregates in disease models). High-resolution imaging is typically performed using confocal microscopy (providing optical sectioning) or increasingly, light-sheet microscopy, which is well-suited for imaging large, cleared organoid samples in 3D with high speed and low photobleaching (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). The primary data are digital images, often multi-channel fluorescence images, which can be quantified for signal intensity, object counts, spatial distributions, and co-localization.
*   **Electrophysiology (Patch-Clamp):** Considered the gold standard for detailed functional analysis of individual neurons and synapses, patch-clamp electrophysiology involves using a fine glass micropipette to form a high-resistance seal (a "gigaseal") with the membrane of a single neuron, allowing for precise measurement and control of its electrical activity (Marton & Pașca, 2020). In voltage-clamp mode, the membrane potential is held constant, allowing measurement of ionic currents (e.g., through voltage-gated channels or neurotransmitter receptors). In current-clamp mode, current is injected, and changes in membrane voltage (including action potentials) are recorded. Patch-clamp can characterize intrinsic neuronal properties (resting potential, input resistance, firing patterns in response to current injection), synaptic transmission (recording postsynaptic currents/potentials evoked by stimulating nearby neurons), and synaptic plasticity mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Pașca, 2022). While technically demanding in dense 3D organoids, successful patch-clamp recordings provide unparalleled detail about single-neuron and synaptic function, crucial for validating network models and understanding fundamental computational elements. The data are high-resolution time series of voltage or current.

The power of modern organoid research lies in the **integration of these multi-modal data types**. For instance, researchers might combine MEA recordings with post-hoc IHC to correlate specific network activity patterns with the underlying cellular architecture. Calcium imaging might be combined with scRNA-seq on the same or parallel samples to link functional ensemble activity to specific molecularly defined cell types (Liu et al., 2021). Optogenetic stimulation combined with MEA or calcium imaging allows for causal interrogation of circuit function. Building comprehensive computational models (discussed in Chapter 6) often requires parameterizing them using data from multiple sources – e.g., using cell type proportions from scRNA-seq, synaptic properties from patch-clamp, and validating network dynamics against MEA/calcium imaging data. This synergistic approach, leveraging complementary techniques to probe the system from molecule to network, provides the rich empirical foundation necessary for the ambitious goal of developing an Organoid Semiotics.

**1.6. Constraints and Considerations: Navigating the Limitations of *In Vitro* Models**

Despite their remarkable capabilities, cerebral organoids are simplified *in vitro* models and possess inherent limitations that must be carefully considered when interpreting experimental findings and assessing their physiological relevance. Acknowledging these constraints is not merely a caveat but essential for framing appropriate research questions, designing informative experiments, and avoiding over-interpretation of results (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). These limitations also define the specific context within which the emergence of computation and semiosis is being investigated in this book.

Perhaps the most fundamental constraint is the **lack of intrinsic vascularization**. The *in vivo* brain is permeated by an intricate capillary network that delivers oxygen and nutrients while removing metabolic waste products. Standard organoid cultures lack this system, relying entirely on passive diffusion from the surrounding medium. This dependence limits the viable size of organoids, typically to a few millimeters in diameter, as diffusion becomes insufficient to support the cells in the core, often leading to hypoxia and necrosis in larger structures (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022). This size constraint limits the scale of networks that can be studied and potentially restricts the emergence of large-scale organizational principles. Furthermore, the absence of blood vessels means the lack of a functional blood-brain barrier (BBB), a critical interface regulating molecular exchange between the circulation and the CNS. Interactions between neural cells and vascular components (endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes forming glial endfeet) which play vital roles in development, homeostasis, and neuroinflammation *in vivo*, are also missing. Significant research efforts are directed towards engineering vascularized organoids, for example, by co-culturing neural progenitors with endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, expressing pro-angiogenic factors like VEGF, or using microfluidic devices to perfuse channels within the tissue, with some promising results but challenges in achieving stable, functional capillary networks remain (Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022).

Another profound limitation is the **absence of physiological sensory input and motor output**. Organoids develop in the controlled, static environment of a culture dish, largely isolated from the rich, dynamic sensory stimuli that constantly shape brain development and function *in vivo*. Similarly, they lack connections to effector organs (muscles, glands) to enact behaviors. Neural activity in organoids is primarily spontaneous, driven by intrinsic network dynamics, or evoked by artificial experimental stimulation (e.g., electrical or optogenetic). This isolation raises fundamental questions about the meaning and relevance of observed activity patterns. Concepts like "representation," "computation," and "learning" are often defined in relation to an organism's interaction with its environment – processing sensory information to guide adaptive behavior. Interpreting organoid activity in these terms requires careful consideration of the system's isolated context. What does a specific pattern of oscillation "represent" in a system devoid of sensory experience? Can "learning" occur meaningfully without behavioral feedback? Exploring these questions is central to Organoid Semiotics, but the answers must be framed within the constraints of the *in vitro* system. Efforts to overcome this limitation include interfacing organoids with microfluidic devices providing controlled chemical stimuli, using patterned optogenetic stimulation to mimic sensory input streams, or even developing "cyborg" systems where organoid activity interfaces with external sensors or simple robotic actuators, though these remain experimental frontiers (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Trujillo & Muotri, 2021).

**Architectural fidelity** also presents challenges. While organoids recapitulate key cell types and aspects of local organization (like VZ/SVZ zones and rudimentary layering), they fail to replicate the overall macroscopic architecture of the human brain. The precise six-layered lamination of the neocortex is typically absent or poorly defined (Heide et al., 2021). The relative positioning and proportion of different brain regions that might stochastically arise in unguided protocols are non-physiological. Crucially, the complex patterns of **long-range connectivity** that define functional brain circuits *in vivo* (e.g., thalamocortical projections, corticospinal tracts, interhemispheric connections via the corpus callosum) are missing in individual organoids (Pașca, 2022). Assembloid approaches, fusing organoids representing different brain regions (e.g., cortex and thalamus, or cortex and spinal cord), offer a strategy to model inter-regional connectivity and circuit formation, representing a significant step forward but still simplifying the *in vivo* complexity (Marton & Pașca, 2020; Pașca, 2022). Furthermore, as noted earlier, certain essential cell types, particularly microglia and vascular cells, are absent unless specifically incorporated, potentially impacting network development, synaptic pruning, and overall homeostasis (Xiang et al., 2022; Popova et al., 2021).

Significant **variability** remains a practical challenge in organoid research. Even when using standardized protocols, considerable differences can be observed in size, morphology, cellular composition, and functional activity between individual organoids within the same batch, and even greater variability exists between batches produced at different times or in different laboratories (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). This heterogeneity can stem from multiple sources, including subtle differences in the starting PSC lines (genetic background, epigenetic state), minor variations in culture reagents or conditions, and inherent stochasticity in developmental processes. This necessitates rigorous experimental design, including the analysis of large numbers of organoids per condition, the use of multiple independent PSC lines, careful process control, and robust quantitative methods to ensure reproducibility and statistical power. Ongoing efforts focus on improving protocol standardization and developing better quality control metrics (Gordon et al., 2023).

The **developmental maturity** achieved by cerebral organoids typically corresponds to prenatal stages, primarily mirroring aspects of the first and second trimesters of human gestation, although maturation continues slowly over many months in culture (Kanton et al., 2022; Pașca, 2022). Features associated with postnatal brain maturation, such as extensive myelination, final stages of synaptic refinement and pruning, and the formation of highly stable, complex network dynamics characteristic of the adult brain, are generally not fully recapitulated. This limits the utility of current organoid models for studying late-onset neurodegenerative diseases (though early pathological signs can be modeled) or cognitive functions dependent on mature circuits. Research is ongoing to develop methods for accelerating maturation *in vitro*, such as modulating specific signaling pathways or providing enhanced environmental enrichment (e.g., complex electrical stimulation patterns), but bridging the gap to postnatal equivalence remains a major goal (Pașca, 2022).

Finally, the increasing sophistication of cerebral organoids, particularly those exhibiting complex network activity or those integrated into assembloids or interfaced systems, raises important **ethical considerations** (Hyun et al., 2020; Farahany et al., 2018 - slightly older but relevant overview). Key concerns revolve around the potential emergence of consciousness, sentience, or pain perception in these systems, their moral status, the appropriate limits of experimentation (e.g., concerning chimerism if transplanted into animals, or prolonged culture duration), and the potential societal implications of creating increasingly brain-like entities *in vitro*. While current scientific consensus holds that existing organoids lack the necessary scale, structure, connectivity, and sensory integration to support consciousness, the rapid pace of technological advancement necessitates ongoing ethical scrutiny, guideline development, and public dialogue (Hyun et al., 2020; Sawai et al., 2021). These ethical dimensions, while only briefly mentioned here, will be explored in greater depth in Chapter 8.

Acknowledging these constraints is crucial for maintaining scientific rigor. Cerebral organoids are not miniature brains in a dish. They are, however, invaluable *models* that capture specific, complex aspects of human neural development and function with unprecedented fidelity *in vitro*. By understanding their limitations, researchers can leverage their strengths appropriately – primarily for studying intrinsic developmental programs, cellular mechanisms, network self-organization, disease pathogenesis in a human context, and, as proposed here, the fundamental principles by which neural tissue might process information and generate meaningful activity patterns, even within a simplified and isolated environment.

**1.7. Framing the Organoid: A Dynamic Biological Substrate for Semiosis and Computation**

Drawing together the detailed descriptions of engineering principles, cellular and architectural characteristics, dynamic functional properties, diverse applications, and inherent limitations, the cerebral organoid emerges as a uniquely potent system for the investigations undertaken in this book. It represents a tangible instantiation of developing human neural tissue, exhibiting remarkable self-organization into complex structures that possess functional capabilities far exceeding traditional two-dimensional cell cultures or simpler neurosphere models (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022). It is precisely this combination of biological realism, experimental tractability, and emergent complexity that positions the organoid as a compelling substrate for exploring the intertwined concepts of biological computation and Peircean semiotics.

The engineering principles (Section 1.1) highlight the interplay between extrinsic control (guiding signals) and intrinsic self-assembly (developmental logic), creating a system that follows biological rules yet generates emergent outcomes. This resonates with computational ideas of algorithms executing on biological hardware and with semiotic notions of legisigns (rules, habits) shaping system behavior. The detailed characteristics (Section 1.2) – the diverse array of specialized neuronal and glial cell types, the formation of progenitor zones and layer-like neuronal arrangements, the development of intricate synaptic connectivity – provide the necessary structural elements, the "hardware" or biological medium, upon which computations can be performed and through which signs can be instantiated and propagated. The presence of human-specific features like oRG cells further underscores its relevance for understanding the foundations of human cognition (Kanton et al., 2022; Gordon et al., 2023).

The dynamic properties (Section 1.3) – the spontaneous generation of complex electrical activity patterns including bursts and oscillations, the responsiveness to stimuli, the establishment of functional connectivity networks, and the potential operation near critical states – represent the observable processes, the "software" or dynamic sign action, occurring within this structure (Sharott et al., 2023; Trujillo et al., 2021). These dynamics are the raw material for information processing and potentially for semiosis. The capacity to track these dynamics using multi-modal techniques (Section 1.5) provides the essential empirical data for analysis and model validation.

The successful use of organoids as models (Section 1.4) for development, disease, and evolution demonstrates their biological validity in capturing meaningful aspects of *in vivo* processes (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022; Pașca, 2022). This validity lends credence to the idea that the computational and semiotic processes investigated within organoids, while rudimentary, may reflect fundamental principles operating in the human brain itself.

Crucially, the acknowledged constraints (Section 1.6) define the specific context of inquiry. We are not investigating computation or semiosis in a fully formed, environmentally embedded brain, but rather their potential emergence within a developing, isolated, structurally simplified, yet functionally active human neural system. This defined context allows for focused investigation of intrinsic network properties and self-organizing principles, potentially revealing foundational aspects of neural signification that might be obscured by the overwhelming complexity of the *in vivo* situation.

Therefore, this chapter formally frames the cerebral organoid as the central object of study for the remainder of this book. It is conceptualized as a complex, adaptive, dynamic system, grounded in human biology, possessing the necessary structural components and exhibiting the functional activity required to support, and potentially instantiate, processes of computation and semiosis. The subsequent chapters will delve into analyzing these processes across different scales (molecular, cellular, network), applying the theoretical lenses of computational neuroscience and Peircean semiotics to interpret the rich phenomenology of the organoid, seeking to understand how information is processed and how meaningful sign action might arise and shape behavior within this unique *in vitro* microcosm of the human brain. The organoid serves as both the biological reality grounding the theoretical inquiry and the experimental system through which hypotheses about neural signification can be, at least in principle, tested.
