# Development, Temporality, and the Growth of Semiotic/Computational Complexity

---

Having explored the fundamental semiotic and computational processes operating at the molecular, cellular, and network levels within cerebral organoids, this chapter shifts the analytical focus to the crucial dimension of **time**. Development is the defining characteristic of organoid systems, unfolding over weeks and months, mirroring albeit imperfectly the protracted timeline of human gestation. This chapter delves into this developmental trajectory, conceptualizing organogenesis not merely as a sequence of structural changes but as a dynamic process guided by the interplay between innate **developmental algorithms**, encoded genetically, and the continuous **semiotic interpretation** of intrinsic and extrinsic cues. The emergence of increasing order and functional sophistication within the developing organoid is examined through the lens of Peirce's universal categories, tracing a progression from states dominated by stochasticity and direct interaction (Firstness and Secondness) towards the establishment of stable structures, regular dynamics, and functional habits (the growth of Thirdness). This framework is then applied to understand **pathological deviations** in development, interpreting disease phenotypes observed in organoid models as arising from disruptions in these fundamental semiotic processes or aberrant computational trajectories. Furthermore, the chapter confronts the challenging question of **learning potential** within these *in vitro* systems, proposing criteria grounded in Peircean principles of adaptive habit change to distinguish genuine learning from mere plasticity and outlining potential experimental and computational strategies for its assessment. Finally, an exploratory analysis is undertaken concerning the relationship between the increasing complexity of sign processes (**semiotic complexity**) and measures of information processing capacity (**computational complexity**) as organoids mature, seeking potential correlations that might illuminate the co-evolution of meaning and computation during neural development.

**5.1. Developmental Algorithms and Semiotic Guidance: The Interplay of Law and Interpretation**

The formation of a cerebral organoid from a seemingly uniform population of pluripotent stem cells into a complex, structured neural tissue is a testament to the power of developmental programs encoded within the genome. These programs, refined over eons of evolution, specify the sequences of cell division, differentiation, migration, and interaction that orchestrate tissue morphogenesis. From a computational perspective, this intricate process can be viewed as the execution of a highly complex, parallel, and distributed **developmental algorithm** (Davidson, 2010 - classic background; Velasco et al., 2021). The genome acts as the repository of the core rules and instructions – the fundamental **Legisigns** (Peirce, CP 2.246) governing development. However, development is not a rigidly deterministic unfolding of a pre-written script. It is a dynamic process profoundly influenced by the cellular environment and intercellular communication, requiring constant **semiotic interpretation** of cues by individual cells to navigate their developmental trajectory appropriately (Short, 2007; Deacon, 2012).

The "developmental algorithm" encoded in the genome specifies, among other things, the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) discussed in Chapter 3. These GRNs define the rules by which cells interpret signals and transition between states (Levante et al., 2022). Key transcription factors act as nodes in these networks, their expression and activity governed by upstream signals and feedback loops. The architecture of these networks, established through evolution, embodies the core computational logic and the fundamental legisigns of development. When external cues, such as morphogen gradients established during directed differentiation protocols (Pașca, 2022; Heide et al., 2021), impinge upon a cell, they act as **Signs**. These signs (e.g., specific morphogen concentrations) are interpreted by the cell's signaling pathways (Section 3.2), leading to changes in transcription factor activity (Interpretants). These internal interpretants then interact with the GRN legisigns, leading to further changes in gene expression (downstream Logical Interpretants) that guide the cell towards a specific fate or behavior appropriate for its inferred position or context.

Therefore, organoid development emerges from the continuous interplay between:
1.  **Innate Genetic Legisigns:** The relatively fixed rules encoded in the genome sequence and GRN architecture, providing the blueprint and the constraints (Thirdness).
2.  **Semiotic Interpretation:** The active process by which individual cells interpret local environmental cues (molecular Signs, mechanical forces, signals from neighbors – involving Firstness and Secondness) based on their internal state and interpretive machinery (receptor expression, signaling pathway status, epigenetic habits – embodying Thirdness).
3.  **Dynamic Interaction:** The ongoing feedback loop where cellular actions (Interpretants, e.g., secretion of signals, migration) modify the local environment, creating new Signs for neighboring cells.

This interplay is crucial for understanding both the robustness and the flexibility of development. **Canalization**, the tendency for development to follow specific pathways despite minor genetic or environmental perturbations, can be understood semiotically as the powerful constraining influence of deeply ingrained developmental **Habits** or **Legisigns** (Peirce, CP 5.476-5.493; Waddington, 1957 - classic concept). These legisigns, embodied in robust GRN motifs (e.g., mutually inhibitory feedback loops stabilizing cell fates) and buffered signaling pathways, guide the developmental process along predictable trajectories, akin to a ball rolling down a valley in Waddington's epigenetic landscape. The stability arises from the dominance of Thirdness (developmental law) over minor fluctuations (Firstness) or external disturbances (Secondness). The interpretation of common environmental signs according to shared internal legisigns ensures that cells largely converge towards appropriate fates within the developing organoid structure (Gordon et al., 2023; Velasco et al., 2021).

However, development also requires flexibility and responsiveness to context. The semiotic interpretation of local cues allows cells to fine-tune their behavior. For example, contact inhibition, where cells stop dividing upon reaching a certain density, involves the interpretation of physical contact signals (Signs, Secondness) leading to changes in cell cycle control (Interpretants). Similarly, precise neuronal migration relies on interpreting guidance cue gradients (Signs) relative to the cell's current position and state. This interpretive aspect allows the "developmental algorithm" to be context-sensitive and adaptive, not merely a blind execution of pre-programmed steps. It introduces elements of Secondness (reaction to immediate context) that modulate the unfolding of Thirdness (the overall developmental plan).

**Modeling** this interplay computationally requires frameworks that can integrate rule-based behavior (genetic algorithms, GRN logic) with agent-based interaction and environmental sensing (Bartocci & Lió, 2016; Tang et al., 2020). Agent-Based Models (ABMs) where each cell agent possesses an internal GRN model and rules for interpreting external signal gradients (Signs) offer a promising approach (Section 3.4). Such models could simulate how the combination of innate programs (Thirdness) and local semiotic interactions (interpretation of Firstness and Secondness) guides self-organization processes like neural rosette formation, layer stratification, and cell migration within the simulated organoid environment. Exploring the parameters governing the strength of canalization versus sensitivity to local cues in these models could provide insights into the balance between robustness and plasticity during development.

The Peircean framework thus enriches the concept of a developmental algorithm by emphasizing the crucial role of ongoing semiotic interpretation. Development is not just computation; it is computation guided by meaning, where cells actively read and respond to signs according to evolved rules and habits, collectively constructing the complex architecture of the organoid.

**5.2. Emergence of Order: The Growth of Thirdness Over Developmental Time**

Cerebral organoids, observed over their lifespan in culture, exhibit a striking progression from relatively simple, disorganized cellular aggregates to increasingly complex structures possessing regular patterns of activity (Heide et al., 2021; Pașca, 2022; Kirihara et al., 2023). This developmental trajectory can be compellingly framed using Peirce's universal categories as the **emergence and growth of Thirdness** (Law, Habit, Regularity, Representation) from initial conditions dominated by Firstness (Potentiality, Chance) and Secondness (Direct Interaction, Reaction) (Peirce, CP 1.326-1.349; Deacon, 2012; Short, 2007). Understanding this temporal emergence of order is key to understanding the development of computational and semiotic capabilities.

*   **Early Stages (Dominated by Firstness and Secondness):** In the initial phases of organoid formation (e.g., embryoid body aggregation, early neural induction), cellular behavior is heavily influenced by stochastic fluctuations (Firstness) in gene expression and signaling (Section 3.5), leading to initial symmetry breaking and cell fate choices. Direct cell-cell interactions (adhesion, juxtacrine signaling – Secondness) are crucial for tissue cohesion and initial signaling events. Physical forces and constraints play a significant role. Network activity, if present, is typically sparse, irregular, and uncoordinated, reflecting largely independent neuronal firing or random local connections (Trujillo & Muotri, 2021). Semiosis is primarily localized and indexical, involving direct responses to immediate molecular or physical signs. Thirdness is present in the form of basic genetic programs being initiated, but stable, higher-level regularities have yet to emerge.

*   **Intermediate Stages (Emergence of Local Order):** As development proceeds, neurogenesis accelerates, neurons migrate outwards, and initial synaptic connections form (Heide et al., 2021; Gordon et al., 2023). Locally ordered structures, such as neural rosettes with polarized progenitors (VZ-like zones) and rudimentary neuronal layers (CP-like zones), begin to appear. This represents the establishment of local **Legisigns** or **Habits** governing cellular arrangement and connectivity. Network activity starts to show more coordination, with the emergence of spontaneous **synchronized bursts** involving local populations of neurons (Liu et al., 2021; Sharott et al., 2023). These bursts, while perhaps initially variable, represent an emergent regularity, a simple form of network-level Thirdness, indicating the formation of functional recurrent excitatory circuits. Semiosis becomes more complex, involving chains of synaptic transmission within local circuits, but global coordination might still be limited.

*   **Later Stages (Growth of Global Order and Stable Habits):** With further maturation over several months, organoids develop more extensive synaptic connectivity, gliogenesis occurs, and neurons mature electrophysiologically (Pașca, 2022; Kanton et al., 2022). Network dynamics become significantly more complex and regular. **Stable network oscillations** across various frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) emerge, reflecting coordinated activity across larger portions of the network (Kirihara et al., 2023; Trujillo et al., 2021). The network may begin to operate near a **critical state**, exhibiting **neuronal avalanches** (Beggs & Plenz, 2003). These stable, reproducible dynamic patterns represent robust **network-level Legisigns** or **Habits** (Thirdness). They signify the establishment of a more stable functional architecture capable of generating structured activity. Synaptic plasticity mechanisms (Section 4.4) allow the network to further refine these habits based on intrinsic activity patterns, strengthening functional pathways and potentially pruning less effective ones. Semiosis now involves complex spatio-temporal patterns (oscillations, avalanches) functioning as higher-level Signs (Section 4.2), potentially enabling more sophisticated forms of information processing and representation within the constraints of the *in vitro* system.

This progression illustrates the core Peircean concept of **evolutionary cosmology** applied at the microscale of organoid development: a tendency for systems to evolve from states of high potentiality and randomness (Firstness), through phases of interaction and reaction (Secondness), towards states characterized by increasing regularity, habit, and lawfulness (Thirdness) (Peirce, CP 6.102-6.317; Deacon, 2012). The emergence of order is not imposed externally but arises intrinsically through self-organization processes driven by local interactions governed by underlying physical and biological laws (including the genetic legisigns).

**Modeling this emergence of order** computationally is a significant challenge and opportunity. Models need to capture the transition from stochastic, local interactions to globally coordinated, regular dynamics.
*   **Agent-Based Models (ABMs)** simulating cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and interaction based on local rules (including stochastic elements) can potentially reproduce the emergence of structural order like layering (Tang et al., 2020).
*   **Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models** incorporating developmental rules (e.g., activity-dependent synapse formation and pruning, homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that regulate overall activity levels) can simulate the maturation of network dynamics from sparse firing to bursting and oscillatory regimes (Gerstner et al., 2014; Vitale et al., 2023). These models can explicitly investigate how changes in local connection rules (micro-level Thirdness) lead to the emergence of global dynamic patterns (macro-level Thirdness).
*   **Dynamical Systems Theory** provides concepts like **attractors** (stable states or patterns towards which the system evolves) which can be formally identified in computational models or inferred from experimental time series data (e.g., from MEA recordings). These attractors represent the emergent stable habits (Thirdness) of the network dynamics (Deco et al., 2008).

By framing organoid development as the temporal growth of Thirdness, Peircean semiotics provides a conceptual narrative that links molecular mechanisms, cellular behaviors, and emergent network functions within a unified evolutionary perspective. It highlights development not just as the building of a structure, but as the establishment of nested layers of semiotic habits and interpretive capabilities.

**5.3. Pathological Semiosis/Computation: Interpreting Disease Models**

Cerebral organoids derived from patient iPSCs or engineered with specific disease-associated mutations have become invaluable tools for modeling neurological and psychiatric disorders (Chapter 1, Section 1.4) (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022; Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022). The integrated framework of Organoid Semiotics offers a potentially powerful lens for interpreting the observed disease phenotypes not merely as structural or functional deficits, but as manifestations of **pathological semiosis** or **aberrant computation** – disruptions in the normal processes of sign interpretation, habit formation, or information processing within the developing neural system.

This perspective suggests that neurological disorders can arise from failures at different levels of the semiotic/computational hierarchy:
*   **Failures in Sign Production/Reception:** Mutations might affect the production of essential signaling molecules (Signs) or the structure/function of receptors responsible for detecting them. This leads to a failure in the initial step of semiosis – the sign is either not generated correctly or cannot be perceived. For example, mutations affecting neurotransmitter synthesis or transport could lead to deficient synaptic communication.
*   **Failures in Interpretation (Interpretant Generation):** Even if a sign is correctly produced and received, mutations affecting intracellular signaling pathways (the interpretive machinery) can lead to incorrect or inappropriate Interpretants. A growth factor signal (Sign) might bind its receptor, but a downstream mutation prevents the activation of survival pathways (Logical Interpretant), leading to apoptosis. This is a failure in the Sign-Interpretant relation, governed by cellular legisigns. Errors in the complex spatio-temporal decoding of signals like Ca²⁺ (Section 3.2) could also fall into this category.
*   **Broken Chains of Semiosis:** Complex processes rely on sequences of sign action. A disruption at any point in the chain – failure to produce an Interpretant that can serve as the next Sign – can derail the entire process. Developmental abnormalities often involve such broken chains, where failure at one step prevents subsequent necessary events.
*   **Faulty Legisigns/Habits:** Disease mutations might alter the fundamental rules or habits governing cellular or network behavior.
    *   *Genetic Legisigns:* Mutations in transcription factors or regulatory DNA elements alter the core rules of the GRN (Section 3.3), leading to incorrect gene expression programs and potentially mis-specified cell types or functions.
    *   *Epigenetic Habits:* Dysregulation of epigenetic modifications can lead to inappropriate gene silencing or activation, disrupting stable cellular identities or long-term adaptive responses.
    *   *Synaptic Habits:* Mutations affecting proteins involved in synaptic plasticity (Section 4.4) can impair the ability of the network to form or modify habits based on experience, potentially contributing to learning disabilities or cognitive deficits. For example, mutations associated with Fragile X syndrome affect synaptic protein synthesis crucial for LTD and LTP.
    *   *Network Habits:* Alterations in E/I balance, often implicated in ASD and epilepsy models (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022; Samarasinghe et al., 2021), represent a disruption in the stable dynamic habits (Thirdness) of the network, leading to aberrant activity patterns like hyperexcitability or hypersynchrony (pathological Signs).
*   **Aberrant Computation:** From a computational viewpoint, these semiotic failures manifest as errors in information processing. Faulty signaling pathways act like broken logic gates; disrupted GRNs execute incorrect algorithms; networks with E/I imbalance exhibit unstable dynamics or fail to process inputs correctly.

Applying this framework to specific disease models in organoids:
*   **Zika-induced Microcephaly:** The virus preferentially infects and kills neural progenitors (Pașca, 2022). Semiotically, this disrupts the very agents responsible for interpreting developmental cues and executing the neurogenesis program. It breaks essential chains of semiosis required for cortical growth. Computationally, it deletes crucial processing units from the developmental algorithm.
*   **Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs):** Models often show altered neuronal differentiation, migration defects, E/I imbalance, and synaptic dysfunction (Geschwind & Pașca, 2022). Semiotically, this suggests potential problems with interpreting guidance cues (migration), establishing stable network habits (E/I balance), or appropriately modifying synaptic habits (plasticity deficits). This could lead to altered processing of social or sensory information (aberrant interpretation of complex signs). Computationally, it reflects errors in network wiring, dynamics, and learning rules.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease (AD):** Accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau in AD organoid models (Pașca, 2022; Xiang et al., 2022) represents a physical disruption (Secondness) that likely interferes with synaptic function and signaling. Semiotically, this could impair the transmission and interpretation of synaptic signs, break signaling chains, and disrupt established network habits, contributing to cognitive decline. Computationally, it introduces noise, degrades connectivity, and impairs plasticity mechanisms.

The value of the semiotic/computational perspective lies in providing a richer vocabulary and conceptual framework for understanding pathology. Instead of just describing *what* is broken (e.g., reduced synapse number), it encourages asking *how* this breakage disrupts the flow of information and meaning within the system – how it leads to failures in sign interpretation, habit formation, or computational function. This may guide the search for therapeutic interventions aimed not just at fixing the structure, but at restoring functional semiosis or computation within the affected networks. Computational models incorporating disease-specific alterations can be used to simulate these disruptions and predict their consequences, potentially identifying key points of failure in the semiotic/computational pathways.

**5.4. Assessing Learning Potential: Semiotic Criteria for Adaptive Habit Change**

A fundamental question arising from the observation of complex dynamics and synaptic plasticity in cerebral organoids is whether these *in vitro* systems possess the capacity for genuine **learning**. While plasticity mechanisms (LTP/LTD) provide the necessary substrate, demonstrating learning requires more than just showing that synaptic strengths *can* change. It necessitates showing an **adaptive modification of behavior or response tendency based on experience**, a process central to Peircean **habit formation** (Section 4.4) (Peirce, CP 5.476-5.493; Short, 2007; Deacon, 2012). Defining and assessing learning potential in isolated organoids, devoid of natural sensory inputs, behaviors, and environmental feedback, presents significant conceptual and methodological challenges (Trujillo & Muotri, 2021).

Distinguishing **learning** from mere **plasticity** is crucial. Plasticity refers to any activity-dependent change in neuronal or synaptic properties. Learning, however, implies an *adaptive* change – a modification that improves the system's ability to predict, respond to, or control its inputs or internal states in a functionally relevant way, based on past experience. From a Peircean standpoint, learning is the process by which a system modifies its **Habits** (Legisigns governing the Sign-Interpretant relationship) in a way that leads to more effective or adaptive **Final Logical Interpretants** in response to specific Signs and their Objects.

Therefore, assessing learning potential in organoids requires moving beyond simply inducing LTP/LTD and focusing on demonstrating **adaptive habit change**. This involves several key criteria, grounded in semiotic principles:

1.  **Identifiable Signs and Objects:** The experimental paradigm must involve presenting specific, controllable input patterns that can function as **Signs** within the organoid network. Ideally, these signs should relate to some identifiable (even if simulated) **Object** or context. For example, different spatio-temporal patterns of optogenetic stimulation could serve as distinct signs.
2.  **Measurable Interpretants:** There must be a way to measure the network's response or **Interpretant** to these signs. This could involve recording changes in overall network activity patterns (e.g., specific oscillations, burst characteristics via MEA or calcium imaging), changes in functional connectivity between specific neuronal populations, or potentially changes in downstream gene expression.
3.  **Experience-Dependent Modification of Habits:** The core requirement is to show that the relationship between the Sign and the Interpretant changes systematically as a result of specific "training" or "experience" protocols. This change represents the modification of the network's interpretive **Habit** or Legisign. For example, does repeated pairing of Sign A with a globally applied 'reward' signal (e.g., a burst of dopamine or suppression of inhibition) cause the network to produce a different Interpretant to Sign A alone afterwards?
4.  **Specificity and Persistence:** The learned habit change should be relatively specific to the trained Sign(s) and should persist for some duration after the training period ends, distinguishing it from transient facilitation or fatigue.
5.  **Adaptiveness (Functionality):** This is the most challenging criterion *in vitro*. Ideally, the learned habit change should confer some functional advantage *within the context of the experimental paradigm*. For instance, if the network learns to produce a specific activity pattern (Interpretant) in response to a 'target' Sign, and this pattern successfully prevents a subsequent simulated 'aversive' stimulus, this demonstrates adaptive learning. Defining meaningful goals and feedback mechanisms *in vitro* is key.

Potential **experimental and computational assays** for probing learning in organoids could include:
*   **Classical Conditioning Paradigms:** Pairing a neutral stimulus (Conditioned Sign, CS – e.g., a specific optogenetic pattern) with a stimulus that reliably evokes a network response (Unconditioned Sign, US – e.g., strong electrical stimulation causing a network burst). Test if the CS alone comes to elicit the response (Conditioned Interpretant) after repeated pairings, indicating associative habit formation.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Paradigms:** Using closed-loop systems where specific patterns of organoid activity (potential Interpretants/actions) are detected and trigger delivery of 'reward' or 'punishment' signals (e.g., application of neuromodulators, optogenetic activation/inhibition of specific pathways). Can the network learn to preferentially generate rewarded activity patterns (adaptive habit formation)? (This draws inspiration from efforts interfacing neural cultures with robotic systems, e.g., Potter, DeMarse et al.).
*   **Pattern Recognition/Discrimination Tasks:** Training the network to produce distinct output patterns (Interpretants) in response to different input patterns (Signs), potentially using feedback to guide plasticity.
*   **Computational Modeling:** Developing SNN models of organoids incorporating realistic plasticity rules (Section 4.5). These models can simulate various learning paradigms, predict the resulting changes in network habits (connectivity matrices, dynamic attractors), and identify potential experimental readouts for verifying learning *in vitro*. Models can help define what constitutes an 'adaptive' change within the limited context.

It is crucial to distinguish genuine associative learning or adaptive control from simpler forms of non-associative plasticity like **habituation** (decreased response to repeated innocuous stimuli) or **sensitization** (increased response after a strong or noxious stimulus). While these also represent forms of habit change in the Peircean sense, they involve simpler modifications of response thresholds rather than the formation of new associations or goal-directed adaptations. Demonstrating these simpler forms in organoids would still be significant as evidence for basic plasticity-dependent habit modification.

Assessing learning potential in organoids requires carefully designed experiments that go beyond standard plasticity induction protocols, incorporating elements of associative pairing, feedback, and functional relevance within the defined *in vitro* context. The Peircean framework, by emphasizing adaptive habit change as the core of learning, provides valuable conceptual criteria for designing these experiments and interpreting their outcomes, pushing the boundaries of what we consider possible for computation and signification in developing human neural circuits *in vitro*.

**5.5. Relating Semiotic Complexity to Computational Complexity During Maturation**

As cerebral organoids develop over time, they exhibit clear increases in structural complexity (cellular diversity, synaptic density, layer formation) and functional complexity (emergence of bursts, oscillations, potentially avalanches) (Chapters 1 & 4). A compelling question arises: can we characterize this maturation process in terms of parallel increases in **semiotic complexity** and **computational complexity**, and explore the potential relationships between them? This inquiry seeks to understand if the growing capacity of the organoid network to engage in more sophisticated sign processes correlates with its enhanced ability to perform complex information processing tasks.

Defining and measuring these two forms of complexity in the context of organoids is challenging but conceptually important:

*   **Semiotic Complexity:** This could involve several dimensions, drawing on Peircean concepts:
    *   *Diversity of Sign Types:* Does the network transition from primarily indexical signaling towards incorporating more abstract, potentially even symbolic, sign functions as it matures and potentially undergoes learning protocols? (Relates to Section 4.3).
    *   *Length of Semiotic Chains:* Do pathways involving longer sequences of Sign-Interpretant steps become functional, allowing for more elaborate processing? (Relates to Section 3.2).
    *   *Complexity of Interpretants:* Does the repertoire of network responses (Interpretants) expand from simple reactions to include stable attractor states, complex oscillations, or patterned outputs? Can the network generate more nuanced or context-dependent interpretations?
    *   *Hierarchical Organization:* Does semiosis become organized hierarchically, with local sign processes integrated into global network states that themselves function as higher-level signs? (Relates to Section 4.2).
    *   *Emergence of Higher-Level Legisigns:* Does the system develop more sophisticated habits or rules governing its behavior, reflected in stable dynamic patterns or learned associations? (Relates to Sections 2.6, 4.4, 4.6).
    Quantifying these aspects is difficult. Potential proxies might include measures of the diversity of observed network states, the predictability or information content of transitions between states, or the ability of the network to learn more complex input-output mappings over time.

*   **Computational Complexity/Capacity:** This can potentially be assessed using measures from information theory, computational neuroscience, and network science:
    *   *Information Processing Measures:* Quantifying mutual information between stimuli and responses, transfer entropy between network regions (indicating directed information flow), or measures of predictive information (how much the current state predicts the future state) (Sharott et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021).
    *   *Dynamic Repertoire:* Measuring the entropy or dimensionality of the network activity space, reflecting the number of distinct states the network can access (Kanton et al., 2022).
    *   *Network Science Metrics:* Tracking changes in graph theoretical properties of functional connectivity networks during maturation (e.g., measures of integration vs. segregation, small-worldness, modularity) which are thought to correlate with computational efficiency (Sharott et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021).
    *   *Criticality Measures:* Assessing proximity to criticality using avalanche analysis, as critical systems are hypothesized to have maximal computational capacity (Beggs & Plenz, 2003; Kirihara et al., 2023).
    *   *Performance on Computational Tasks:* Evaluating the ability of the organoid (or a model thereof) to perform specific computational tasks, such as pattern classification or sequence memory, and how this ability changes with maturation or training.

The central hypothesis is that these two forms of complexity are likely **intertwined and co-evolve** during organoid development. Increased computational capacity (e.g., ability to integrate information over longer timescales, maintain more distinct states) may be necessary to support more complex semiotic processes (e.g., forming symbolic associations, generating context-dependent interpretants). Conversely, the emergence of effective semiotic strategies (e.g., stable interpretive habits, meaningful representations) likely enhances the network's computational power by allowing it to process information more efficiently and adaptively. Thirdness, in the Peircean sense (emergent law, habit, representation), seems crucial for both: stable computational regimes and reliable semiotic function depend on established regularities.

**Exploring this relationship** requires longitudinal studies tracking multiple measures across organoid maturation. For example:
*   Correlating developmental time with changes in electrophysiological markers (e.g., oscillation complexity, avalanche parameters) and simultaneously with structural maturation markers (e.g., synapse density, cell type diversification from transcriptomics) (Gordon et al., 2023; Kirihara et al., 2023).
*   Using computational models (e.g., SNNs with developmental rules) to simulate maturation and track both computational metrics (information processing capacity) and proxies for semiotic complexity (e.g., stability of learned representations, diversity of dynamic states functioning as signs) (Vitale et al., 2023).
*   Developing experimental paradigms where the organoid is challenged with tasks requiring increasing computational/semiotic sophistication over time and assessing its performance trajectory.

While definitive quantification of semiotic complexity remains a major theoretical challenge, framing organoid maturation as a process of co-evolving computational capacity and semiotic competence provides a rich conceptual framework. It suggests that the development of sophisticated information processing in neural systems is inseparable from the development of the capacity for meaningful sign action. Investigating this co-evolution in the simplified, yet increasingly complex, context of cerebral organoids may offer fundamental insights into the deep relationship between computation, meaning, and the emergence of mind-like properties from biological matter.
